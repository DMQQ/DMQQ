### **Top projects**

My biggest and most advanced project i've built so far is e-commerce shop, it's made up of [mobile](https://github.com/DMQQ/shop-mobile) and [backend](https://github.com/DMQQ/shop-server) part. App has many features like: shopping cart, authentication with email account verification, watchlist, many searching and filtering methods and the most importantly it handles payments. The mobile part was made in React Native with Typescript and Expo. Backend part was made in NodeJs, and more specifically in NestJS and MySQL as database. Queries to database are managed by TypeORM library that makes the code easier to update and manage. Payments are based on Stripe API that provides all the necessary methods.
